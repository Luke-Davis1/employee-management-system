# Employee Management system

In this project, I created multiple python scripts to handle various SQL operations to modify a database containing employee records. The data itself has been kept private to respect my professor's wishes. Throughout these scripts, I complete operations to update employe information such as phone numbers and emails, updating employment status, and adjusting employee salary.

## SQL topics Utilized
